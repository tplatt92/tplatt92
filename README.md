Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tom Platt. I am a bootcamp student at School of Code in the UK hoping to start a new career as a Front-End engineer. I love to design and create and currently diving into the world of JavaScript. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a basic restaurant order application. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about different responsive design. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source project that my skill level will allow me to contribute towards.

-- 100 Days of Code Challenge --

Day 1: Continued with module 5 on Scrimba's front end career path - creating a twitter clone. Looked at Data attributes, how to create an interactive like button with counter. 

Day 2: Continued with creating a very basic twitter clone. Explored conditional rendering of CSS and how initialise CSS styles using conditional statements in JavaScript. I created a like button which toggles a red heart, a retweet button which glows green when clicked and a reply button which renders the replies onto the page when clicked and hides them when clicked again. 

Day 3: Looked at UUID's and how to generate them using a CDN. Imported and implemented the CDNs use to the twitter clone app. Generated a new UUID for each new tweet. 

Day 4: Rendered new tweets onto the twitter clone feed. Adding a new object to the existing array and finished the styling of the app. I enjoyed this project overall and found it challenging. Understanding the logic behind adding the button interactivity was difficult and something I definitely need to explore further in the next solo project. 

Day 5: Started a solo project of a restaurant ordering app following a figma design. I rendered the HTML into the browser using JavaScript and created a function which adds a food item to an order which is rendered below. Started to implement a remove function but struggled with this. 

Day 6: Finished implementing the remove item function and allowed for the tracking of the total price of the order. Also styled the app to the figma specifications. Added payment modal to appear when complete order button is pressed and used a form input fields to display input information. 

Day 7: Dove deeper into some essential JavaScript concepts. Learnt about object destructuring which enables us to get properties from objects and store into variables. I learnt about the .map(), join() methods and arrow functions and applied them to a variety of different coding exercises. 

Day 8: Learnt about the .reduce() method and completed a challenge which utilised all the learning from the past 2 days. It allowed me to apply object destructuring, .map(), .join(), .reduce() and utilise arrow functions. I then started to learn about the use cases of the ternary operator '?' and used it to refactor examples of code that used if/else statements. 

Day 9: Recapped arrow functions and ternary operators. Completed challenges to gain muscle memory and familiary when writing with the new syntax. 

Day 10: Used Scrimba and learnt about short circuiting with OR (||) and AND (&&) in order to make more concise conditional statements. Completed challenges that allowed me to apply this. 

Day 11: Finished module 5 using common constructor functions such as date() as well as looking at how to create my own error() constructors to handle error messages within my code. Continued with FreeCodeCamps data structures and algorithms module and tried to apply the knowledge I have learnt to write some basic algorithmic scripts which I was successful with to varying degrees. Practicing my JS application is definitely something I need to ensure I consistently practice. 

Day 12: Started my day with some codewars challenges to continue my JS application then began Scrimba Module 6 on responsive design. Looked at relative units such as %, em, and rems and their various applications. 

Day 13: Signed up to LeetCode and its 30 days of JavaScript problem set. Completed several problems to enhance my understanding of how to approach different problems using JS. 

Day 14: Solved severeal problems on CodeWars using JavaScript. Moved on to 7kyu challenges and learnt about a few new methods to convert values into numbers: the unary operator (+) to turn a string into a number; the Number() and parseInt() methods which offer greater control when converting values into numbers; Math.sqrt(n) which finds the square root of a number; as well as applying previous learnt methods such as .map(), .join(), .split(), for loops and arrow functions. 

Day 15: First day of my School of Code bootcamp. We were introduced to the staff and the challenges that lay ahead, we looked at how to become effective learners and what daily practices to adopt in order to get the most out the bootcamp.

Day 16: Started my day recapping useful string methods, and playing around with them in my dev tools. Methods like .length, finding an integer [], .includes,  and .indexOf. During the second day of the bootcamp we looked at useful developer tools such as AI, git and github. 

Day 17: Day 3 of School of code bootcamp. Had an incredibly interesting talk from Ira Rainey: a senior software engineer at Microsoft. We learnt a lot about imposter syndrome and growth mindset. In the afternoon we experimented with differed tools such as draw.io to help us create effective plans for our code, working collaboratively with others to solve different problems using AGILE. 

Day 18: Day 4 of School of Code Bootcamp. We dove deeper into using AGILE and other methods such as LEAN and MVP. We then planned our first Hackathon which was to create an escape room game using scratch. We utilised tools such as draw.io to create flow diagrams in order to help us plan out the day and looked at project management tools on Github like milestones and issues. 

Day 19: Day 5 of School of Code Bootcamp. Our first hackathon creating an escape room game using scratch. We worked throughout the day to produce a working piece of software with three different rooms. We were very happy with what we produced and presented it back to our cohort reflecting on what went well, what we could improve next time and included a demo of our planning process and the game itself. 

Day 20: With our JavaScript fundamentals week coming up, I reviewed the basics of JavaScript including Primitive values, string methods, the Math Object and simple Boolean logic including conditionals and comparison operators.

Day 21: Continued to review JS fundamentals today I focused on the array and object data structures. I looked at how to access and add/remove data from them and reviewed some important array methods including: push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), slice(), splice() and more. Tomorrow morning I will review different ways of looping and iterating over data.

Day 22: Reviewed different loop types and explored their strengths and weaknesses. When different loops are most useful. Week 2 began of the School of Code bootcamp where we met our new teams for the weeks and began the day with an engaging workshop on growth mindset. In the afternoon we looked at some JavaScript fundamentals and went through exerises to practice some of those basics. 

Day 23: Starting the morning recapping arrays and objects before the bootcamp began. During the days bootcamp we focused on looping and functions. We looked at while, for loops and then function basics and higher order functions. We took on several challenges culminating in creating a function that would add and withdraw money from a bank account and update the accounts total. Into the evening I completed some codewars challenges that utilised some array methods like reduce() and filter(). 

Day 24: Started the morning recapping object Methods and using the 'this' keyword. Then went into the bootcamp confident as we were focusing on arrays and how to utilise them when building applications. We build a quiz application which stored answers within an array and then used conditionals to check whether user input matched that answer, keeping tracking of the users total score and reporting it to them at then end. In the evening I completed a couple of code wars challenges including one 6 kata challenge which I was very satisfied with.
