<summary>-- 100 Days of Code Challenge --</summary>
<br>
Day 1: Continued with module 5 on Scrimba's front end career path - creating a twitter clone. Looked at Data attributes, how to create an interactive like button with counter. 

Day 2: Continued with creating a very basic twitter clone. Explored conditional rendering of CSS and how initialise CSS styles using conditional statements in JavaScript. I created a like button which toggles a red heart, a retweet button which glows green when clicked and a reply button which renders the replies onto the page when clicked and hides them when clicked again. 

Day 3: Looked at UUID's and how to generate them using a CDN. Imported and implemented the CDNs use to the twitter clone app. Generated a new UUID for each new tweet. 

Day 4: Rendered new tweets onto the twitter clone feed. Adding a new object to the existing array and finished the styling of the app. I enjoyed this project overall and found it challenging. Understanding the logic behind adding the button interactivity was difficult and something I definitely need to explore further in the next solo project. 

Day 5: Started a solo project of a restaurant ordering app following a figma design. I rendered the HTML into the browser using JavaScript and created a function which adds a food item to an order which is rendered below. Started to implement a remove function but struggled with this. 

Day 6: Finished implementing the remove item function and allowed for the tracking of the total price of the order. Also styled the app to the figma specifications. Added payment modal to appear when complete order button is pressed and used a form input fields to display input information. 

Day 7: Dove deeper into some essential JavaScript concepts. Learnt about object destructuring which enables us to get properties from objects and store into variables. I learnt about the .map(), join() methods and arrow functions and applied them to a variety of different coding exercises. 

Day 8: Learnt about the .reduce() method and completed a challenge which utilised all the learning from the past 2 days. It allowed me to apply object destructuring, .map(), .join(), .reduce() and utilise arrow functions. I then started to learn about the use cases of the ternary operator '?' and used it to refactor examples of code that used if/else statements. 

Day 9: Recapped arrow functions and ternary operators. Completed challenges to gain muscle memory and familiary when writing with the new syntax. 

Day 10: Used Scrimba and learnt about short circuiting with OR (||) and AND (&&) in order to make more concise conditional statements. Completed challenges that allowed me to apply this. 

Day 11: Finished module 5 using common constructor functions such as date() as well as looking at how to create my own error() constructors to handle error messages within my code. Continued with FreeCodeCamps data structures and algorithms module and tried to apply the knowledge I have learnt to write some basic algorithmic scripts which I was successful with to varying degrees. Practicing my JS application is definitely something I need to ensure I consistently practice. 

Day 12: Started my day with some codewars challenges to continue my JS application then began Scrimba Module 6 on responsive design. Looked at relative units such as %, em, and rems and their various applications. 

Day 13: Signed up to LeetCode and its 30 days of JavaScript problem set. Completed several problems to enhance my understanding of how to approach different problems using JS. 

Day 14: Solved severeal problems on CodeWars using JavaScript. Moved on to 7kyu challenges and learnt about a few new methods to convert values into numbers: the unary operator (+) to turn a string into a number; the Number() and parseInt() methods which offer greater control when converting values into numbers; Math.sqrt(n) which finds the square root of a number; as well as applying previous learnt methods such as .map(), .join(), .split(), for loops and arrow functions. 

Day 15: First day of my School of Code bootcamp. We were introduced to the staff and the challenges that lay ahead, we looked at how to become effective learners and what daily practices to adopt in order to get the most out the bootcamp.

Day 16: Started my day recapping useful string methods, and playing around with them in my dev tools. Methods like .length, finding an integer [], .includes,  and .indexOf. During the second day of the bootcamp we looked at useful developer tools such as AI, git and github. 

Day 17: Day 3 of School of code bootcamp. Had an incredibly interesting talk from Ira Rainey: a senior software engineer at Microsoft. We learnt a lot about imposter syndrome and growth mindset. In the afternoon we experimented with differed tools such as draw.io to help us create effective plans for our code, working collaboratively with others to solve different problems using AGILE. 

Day 18: Day 4 of School of Code Bootcamp. We dove deeper into using AGILE and other methods such as LEAN and MVP. We then planned our first Hackathon which was to create an escape room game using scratch. We utilised tools such as draw.io to create flow diagrams in order to help us plan out the day and looked at project management tools on Github like milestones and issues. 

Day 19: Day 5 of School of Code Bootcamp. Our first hackathon creating an escape room game using scratch. We worked throughout the day to produce a working piece of software with three different rooms. We were very happy with what we produced and presented it back to our cohort reflecting on what went well, what we could improve next time and included a demo of our planning process and the game itself. 

Day 20: With our JavaScript fundamentals week coming up, I reviewed the basics of JavaScript including Primitive values, string methods, the Math Object and simple Boolean logic including conditionals and comparison operators.

Day 21: Continued to review JS fundamentals today I focused on the array and object data structures. I looked at how to access and add/remove data from them and reviewed some important array methods including: push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), slice(), splice() and more. Tomorrow morning I will review different ways of looping and iterating over data.

Day 22: Reviewed different loop types and explored their strengths and weaknesses. When different loops are most useful. Week 2 began of the School of Code bootcamp where we met our new teams for the weeks and began the day with an engaging workshop on growth mindset. In the afternoon we looked at some JavaScript fundamentals and went through exerises to practice some of those basics. 

Day 23: Starting the morning recapping arrays and objects before the bootcamp began. During the days bootcamp we focused on looping and functions. We looked at while, for loops and then function basics and higher order functions. We took on several challenges culminating in creating a function that would add and withdraw money from a bank account and update the accounts total. Into the evening I completed some codewars challenges that utilised some array methods like reduce() and filter(). 

Day 24: Started the morning recapping object Methods and using the 'this' keyword. Then went into the bootcamp confident as we were focusing on arrays and how to utilise them when building applications. We build a quiz application which stored answers within an array and then used conditionals to check whether user input matched that answer, keeping tracking of the users total score and reporting it to them at then end. In the evening I completed a couple of code wars challenges including one 6 kata challenge which I was very satisfied with. 

Day 25: Our second Hackathon creating a rock,paper, scissors game. It was a super fun day where we created a working game of rock, paper, scissors and even managed to go above and beyond by manipulating the DOM to render it out which presented some challenges which we overcame for the most part. We definitely needed to continue to embed AGILE principles and get comfortable with that workflow and utilise githubs project management features more effectively. 

Day 26: Embedded some of the weekly concepts learned using the exorcism platform which has been very enjoyable. 

Day 27: Decided to start a portfolio project in order to build a central hub to display my projects. I completed the navbar and learnt about the css clamp feature to create responsive typography. 

Day 28: Completed the hero section of my personal portfolio that was responsive to different screen sizes. Started the third week of school of code confident, we looked at debugging and how to use the dev tools to help debug. We learnt about different error types and how we can use systematic processes to handle them. 

Day 29: Completed the skills section, responsive to different screen sizes. During the bootcamp we focused on using JS to manipulate the DOM. We looked at grabbing, creating, and modifying different elements on the page. 

Day 30: Completed codewars challenges and achieved the 5kyu rank! We focused on JavaScript events and how we can use eventListeners to create dynamic user interactions. We completed a series of challenges that utilised different events and other concepts that we had previously learnt in week two which was challenging but really rewarding. 

Day 31: We recapped how we can get information from arrays and objects but utilising data sets which include several levels of nesting. Once we achieved that we looked at external API's and get requests using fetch, async functions, promises and await. This was a challenging day for me and I found understanding promises difficult, I did some extra reading in the evening in preparation for the hackathon where we would have to create our own weather application using an external API. 

Day 32: Hackathon day went incredibly well and my team and I were very happy with what we managed to achieve. We create a fully functioning weather application which used an external weather API and rendered out the information onto a clean looking interface. Even after the day was over, I took it upon myself to hook up another geolocation API in order for users to be able to input a location and get the weather from that API. 

Day 33: Completed the bootcamps weekend task which was to use another API and render out some information that had been displayed. I teamed up with another bootcamper and we used a Pokemon API to create our very own working Pokedex application. Using a Pokedex template, we hooked the API up to different elements and successfully rendered out the information we wanted to the pokedex. We were incredibly happy with the results. 

Day 34: Spent some time looking at ways to create animations and interesting SVGs. In the evening I started learning about Nodejs and npm. 

Day 35: Refreshed our knowledge from the previous week on APIs and learned about the setTimeout and setInterval functions. We then created a working clock that was connecting to our locations real time. 

Day 36: We were introduced to Nodejs and initial set up. How to initialise a node project and install different packages. 

Day 37: Used nodejs to create CRUD functions that would form the basis of our API in the hackathon at the end of the week.

Day 38: Introduced to expressjs to create our own server which would call upon different CRUD functions depending on what type of request would be created.

Day 39: Hackathon day: We had to create our own API from scratch with crud functionality and different types of HTML requests. We were successful and managed to complete the task and even some stretch goals. We managed to hook the backend up to the front end using the cors package. We created a button which generated a random quote to the page using a get request that delivered an array of quotes and then selected one at random. 

Day 40: Weekend project was to create our own functioning API on our own, I created CRUD functionality for an API that processed user data. 

Day 41: Continued with the weekend project and managed not only to get each type of request working but connected it to the front end and manageed to build out a sleek design which could add and retrieve user data using query parameters. 

Day 42: Introduced to databases and why they are preferred to in situations over a JSON API. 

Day 43: Started to learn SQL and how to create SQL query strings. Really enjoyed learning the syntax as it reads like english. We used a resource called SQL bolt to learn the basics. 

Day 44: Continued with SQL bolt which taught us about more complex queries involving aggregate functions and then different table joins. Ended the day with a SQL murder mystery challenge which put our skills to the test.

Day 45: Learnt about using nodejs to extract data from our database through different route handlers. 

Day 46: Hackathon Friday. Our group worked so well together which meant for a stress free hackathon. We ensured that we completed it properly with everyone on the same page and no one being left behind. We managed to create our own SQL database with a CRUD functioning API and it worked without hiccups. Finished our destination section and introduced ourselves to scoll trigger animations. We managed to create stacking panels with a smooth scroll implemented and it looks fantastic. 

Day 47: Completed the crew section on our space tourism site which included another scroll trigger animation. This time we wanted the panels to slide horizontally and we managed to achieve this after some teething issues. Overall we are really happy with it. 

Day 48: Continued work on the space tourism site. Managed to get the technology page working and is now fully responsive. Just need to figure out a way to position the image and size it correctly.

Day 49: We were introduced to testing and had a guest lecture on the imoportance of Test Driven Development and the advantages of automated testing rather than manual tesing. At the end of the day I filtered through our space projects and pruned unneccessary pieces of code. 

Day 50: We learnt about Unit testing using vitest. I really enjoyed today as we got to put out JS skills into practice by writing an ever increasingly complex function. What was difficult was remembering to use Test Driven Development priciples and ensure that we write the test first before we write any code. Although this seemed counterintuitive, I can appreciate the power of it and will start incorporating it into my working practices. 

Day 51: Today we learnt about end to end testing looking at user flows and how we can test that they work as expected using Playwright. This was a really interesting tool that includes a useful GUI that shows you what your tests are doing. We looked at how to use different locators, actions and assertions. Started to learn react and began the react library course of FreeCodeCamp.

Day 52: Looked into API testing using a combination of different testing packages like vitest and supertest. It was really interesting to see how we could similate different requests and automate them rather than using thunderclient. Continued with the React course into the evening. 

Day 53: Complete the hackathon which included building out a string of tests for an API as well as an end to end test for a user flow. This was the most difficult hackathon yet but we came out the other side smiling and had such a fun time. 

Day 54: Created a plan for our next project which we will use a variety of new technologies. This is a free lance portfolio projects for a business that will utilise the website. This is a collaborative project with a fellow bootcamper and being led by an experience software engineer. I am so excited to be a part of this project and learning about React development.
