-- 100 Days of Code Challenge --

Day 1: Continued with module 5 on Scrimba's front end career path - creating a twitter clone. Looked at Data attributes, how to create an interactive like button with counter. 

Day 2: Continued with creating a very basic twitter clone. Explored conditional rendering of CSS and how initialise CSS styles using conditional statements in JavaScript. I created a like button which toggles a red heart, a retweet button which glows green when clicked and a reply button which renders the replies onto the page when clicked and hides them when clicked again. 

Day 3: Looked at UUID's and how to generate them using a CDN. Imported and implemented the CDNs use to the twitter clone app. Generated a new UUID for each new tweet. 

Day 4: Rendered new tweets onto the twitter clone feed. Adding a new object to the existing array and finished the styling of the app. I enjoyed this project overall and found it challenging. Understanding the logic behind adding the button interactivity was difficult and something I definitely need to explore further in the next solo project. 

Day 5: Started a solo project of a restaurant ordering app following a figma design. I rendered the HTML into the browser using JavaScript and created a function which adds a food item to an order which is rendered below. Started to implement a remove function but struggled with this. 

Day 6: Finished implementing the remove item function and allowed for the tracking of the total price of the order. Also styled the app to the figma specifications. Added payment modal to appear when complete order button is pressed and used a form input fields to display input information.
